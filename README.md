## Getting Started with Node-RED

### Introduction

This Getting Started guide covers getting Node-RED running (either on a groov EPIC processor, groov Edge Appliance, or a computer), and provides a few examples of how to use Node-RED.

Node-RED comes pre-installed on groov EPIC processors and the groov Edge Appliance.

If you want to run Node-RED on your own computer, continue to installing Node-RED.

If using a groov EPIC processor or groov Edge Appliance, continue to the Hello, world! example.

#### Node-RED Installation

**Overview**
Node-RED runs on the Node.js platform, a cross-platform JavaScript engine. For more information on Node.js, see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Node-RED is pre-installed on groov EPIC processors and the groov Edge Appliance.

To install Node.js and Node-RED on your own computer, see the following instructions.

**Install Node.js**
The recommended installer is on the Node.js [homepage](https://nodejs.org/), and other downloads are available on their [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Our SNAP PAC nodes require Node.js version 4.4.5 or newer, so get the current stable version.

For Windows, it’s a typical installer that you download and run.

For Linux, Node.js is available via many [package managers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). For instance, instructions for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu and the Raspberry Pi’s Raspbian are [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions). There are also various [binary downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) available.

Once Node.js is installed, you should verify that the version is 4.4.5 or newer. Open a command prompt or terminal window, and enter:

```javascript
node -v
```

You should get a response like:
